# Quick Summary

This is a monorepo containing all the code for a browser extension to generate summaries of any article with the click of a button.

## Build Instructions

### Chrome Extension

In order to try out this extension, first clone this repository.

Making sure you have the latest Node.js version available, run the following commands:

1. `cd chrome-extension`
2. `npm install`
3. `npm run build`. This should generate a new `build` folder in the `chrome-extension` directory.
4. Next, open `chrome://extensions` in your browser and click the "Load Unpacked" button. You may need to toggle developer mode on the top right of the page.

5. When your file browser opens, select the new `build` folder that was created. You should now see our extension in the list.

6. And the extension should be installed! To try it out, just press the extension icon on a news article. A summary should load within a few seconds.

### Backend Microservice

1. Make sure you have Docker installed.
1. Clone the repository
1. `cd nlp-flask-app`
1. `docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up && docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up`
1. Change line 13 in `./chrome-extension/src/js/popup/utils.js` to use the local server. The URL inside fetch should be changed to something like `http://localhost:5000/summarize` if you are running the chrome extension and the backend on the same server.
   - Do note that the docker image takes a significant amount of time to build as it has to download a large model.
   - The frontend will need to be rebuilt after changing the server address.
1. To use the backend again without rebuilding, just run `docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up`
1. If you want to run the container headless, run `docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d`
